### System information
- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a tutorial script provided in Tutorial section)**:
- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or Windows 10 v1709 x64)**:
- **TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)**:
- **TensorFlow version (use command below)**:
- **Python version**: 
- **CUDA/cuDNN version (Only neccessary if you are using Tensorflow-gpu)**:
- **GPU model and memory (Only neccessary if you are using Tensorflow-gpu)**:
- **Exact command/script to reproduce (optional)**:

You can collect some of this information using tensorflow's environment capture script (For -Unix):

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with

python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"

### Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in astroNN (instead of Tensorflow's problem) or a feature request.

### Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
